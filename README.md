# Burgerland Plan Your Day Flow

This is my proposed flow for the "Plan Your Day" flow for Burgerland, and a partial code implementation.
The main user flow includes: arriving at the "PlanYourDay" page, completing the DPF (Date and Party Form), then the available ticket packages are generated and presented. 
Once the ticket package is chosen, the user can continue exploring the park: making dinner or show reservations, bookmarking attractions, etc. Or they may proceed to checkout, which would present a summary of the tickets and reservations chosen and integrate with payment.
#
Other elements considered are: interactive map and itinerary builder - in which a user would be able to edit one of the presented popular itineraries or start a new one, and eventually a personal map with the marked itinerary could be generated.

## Installation and Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18.x or later
- npm or yarn package manager

### Local Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Run development server
yarn dev
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Build the application
yarn build

# Start production server
yarn start
```

## Technical Considerations

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation support
- ARIA labels and roles for interactive elements
- Screen reader compatibility
- Consider integrating an AI agent

### Localization
For the final implementation consider:
- adding i18n for multiple language support
- Right-to-left (RTL) layout support
- Currency and date format localization

### Testing
For the final implementation consider:
- Unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library
- Integration tests for critical user flows
- E2E tests using Cypress
- Accessibility testing with axe-core
- Performance testing using Lighthouse
- Cross-browser testing strategy

### Performance Optimization
- NextJS provides handles Image optimization and lazy loading
- NextJS provides handles Server-side rendering for initial page load
- Used ReactQuery for caching API responses
- Consider Progressive Web App capabilities
